Thank you for using TimeNote. Your privacy is critically important to us. This policy outlines how we handle your data.

## Data We Do Not Collect

TimeNote is designed to be a private and secure space for you. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data or the content you create within the app.

We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, location, or contacts. We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising frameworks.

## Data Handled by the App

**1. Local Storage:**
All your time logs, goals, and notes are stored exclusively on your local device.

**2. iCloud Sync:**
To provide a seamless cross-device experience, TimeNote uses Apple's CloudKit technology to sync your data. 
* This feature is optional and must be enabled by you.
* When enabled, your data is securely stored in your **private iCloud account**. 
* We, the developers of TimeNote, **do not have any access** to the data stored in your iCloud. The synchronization process is handled entirely by Apple's secure infrastructure, and only you can access your data.
