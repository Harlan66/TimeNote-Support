## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Is my data private and secure?**

A: Absolutely. We take your privacy very seriously. All your data is stored 100% locally on your device. If you choose to enable sync, your data is transmitted and stored securely and privately in your **personal iCloud account**, which we, the developers, have no access to.

**Q2: How does iCloud sync work?**

A: Once enabled, iCloud sync works automatically in the background to keep your time logs consistent across all your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.) that are signed into the same Apple ID.

**Q3: How do I restore my previous purchases (if any)?**

A: If you have made any in-app purchases and need to restore them on a new device, please look for a "Restore Purchases" button within the app's settings or premium features page. This will restore any non-consumable purchases tied to your Apple ID.
